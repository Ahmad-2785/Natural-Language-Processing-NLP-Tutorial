* _**Natural language processing**_ is a subset of Artificial intelligence that helps computers to understand, interpret, and utilize the human languages.

* NLP allows computers to communicate with peoples using human languages. 
* NLP also provides computers with the ability to read text, hear speech, and try to intrepret it. 
* NLP draws several disciplines, including Computational linguistics and computer science, as this attempts to fill the gap in between human and computer communication.


* NLP breaks down language into shorter, more basic pieces, called tokens(period, words, etc), and attempts to understand the relationships of tokens. This approach often uses higher-level NLP features, such as:

- **Sentiment analysis:** It identifies the general mood, or subjective opinions, which is stored in large amount of texts, It is more useful for opinion mining.

- **Contextual Extraction:** Extract structured data from text-base sources.
- **Text-to-Speech and Speech-to-text:** It transforms the voice into text and vice a versa.
- **Document Summarization:** Automatically creates a synopsis, condensing large amounts of text.
- **Machine Translation:** Translates the text or speech of one language into another language.
